# mapchart_colorer

This is a simple tool intended to automate coloring a US county map using the website https://mapchart.net/usa-counties.html. I have no affiliation with this website.

Presuming you have LibreOffice or Excel spreadsheet data with US county names, together with some numeric data column, this script will import your data.  The function color_map allows you to specify which columns contain county names, state names (either abbreviated or not), and numeric data.  It allows for choosing which colors to use, and what the numeric thresholds are for switching from one threshold to another.
